_This file will be used to document reflections and lessons learned after each sprint._

## Sprint 1 — Dates: 2025-07-13 to 2025-07-20

### What Went Well

- Creating the Wireframes went according to plan, though difficult due to the lack of knowledge beforehand.
- Designer feel confident in creating even better design's in the future.
- Backend was implemented successfully through a bit of AI assistance since the time was running out.

### What Didn’t Go Well

- Designer feel like he didn't manage to get the most out of Figma with Color Schemes and Components etc. which made some parts very repetitive.
- Main focus in the future will be to learn how to use these to become more effective and save time.
- Even though the backend was implemented in time it was a very close call, make sure that it doesn't become a reoccurrence moving forward.

### Action Items / Improvements for Next Sprint

- From here It's very likely that the project will see an improvement in most of the areas, the main improvement should be to finish the Sprint quicker.
- Not because It's needed but because It's possible due to the generous amount of time given due to the lack of knowledge beforehand.

### What Went Well

- The developing went well with part vibe coding and reviewing the code generated.
- Designer has been working more on creating wireframes and making them possible to navigate on Figma, still feels like he can improve and will keep working.
- The time span given gave a calming vibe which made it easier to focus on small parts and making sure the site looks aesthetically pleasing.

### What Didn’t Go Well

- Everything went surprisingly smooth this Sprint, main focus has been on developing the site which went according to plan.
